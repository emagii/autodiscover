# autodiscover
Moritz Friedrich: Generates a valid autodiscover.xml for mail clients.

eMagii: This is a reformatted https://github.com/Radiergummi/php-autodiscover,
simply so you can clone it, or unpack it in the webserver.

> **Note:** I've written this years ago. The PHP code isn't exactly up to standards anymore; while everything still works, I'm soon™ going to bring the project up to date and publish it as a composer package.

## Usage
When mail clients are setup the first time, they'll try to connect to the subdomain `autodiscover.` of the respective mail domain to recieve their self-configuration information as an XML file. At a basic level, this includes things like mail server adresses for imap/pop and smtp servers, ports, SSL usage etc. Much more is possible though.  
This script generates a valid autodiscover.xml file upon request, but inserts server information based on the email address. For example, if you own several vhosts, say, `example.com`, `example.org`, `foo.com` and `bar.com`. They all have subdomains for imap and smtp, like `imap.example.com` and `smtp.example.com`.  
When setting up email accounts, it would be nice if the basic stuff would be automatically inserted - the mail servers, their ports, etc. That is exactly what this project does.  

## Setup
Put the *autodiscover*-folder into your webroot. Set up a new subdomain (via Hosting control panel or as a vhost using your own webserver) for `autodiscover.example.com`.  

## Configuration
The least information neeeded to autoconfigure email clients is the mail service domains and ports:
Inside of `autodiscover.php` you will find this code:

```php
    // pop settings
    $popServer = 'pop.' . $domain; // pop.example.com
    $popPort = 110;
    $smtpSSL = false;
    
    // imap settings
    $imapServer = 'imap.' . $domain; // imap.example.com
    $imapPort = 993;
    $imapSSL = true;
    
    // smtp settings
    $smtpServer = 'smtp.' . $domain; // smtp.example.com
    $smtpPort = 587;
    $smtpSSL = true;
  ```
The variable `$domain` is populated with the domain from the request.

## Debugging
If the client throws an error or is unable to retrieve the config, you can enable a debug log holding each individual http request by uncommenting [line 20 in `autodiscover.php`](./autodiscover/autodiscover.php#L20).  

## Known problems
 - Outlook takes pretty long for servers without a valid SSL certificate, so make sure to get one
 - Apple Mail doesn't implement the autodiscover protocol correctly, if you depend on this client, you might need to fiddle with the response
